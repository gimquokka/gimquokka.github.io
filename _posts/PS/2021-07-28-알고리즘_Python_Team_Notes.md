No matter how many algorithmic problems you solve, anyone who prepares for coding tests will soon be forgotten and find out how they solved them in the past. I also felt that I had a lot of experience and spent a lot of time in this process, so I felt the need to organize it systematically, so I organized _**Python-Team-Notes**_ for coding tests. I hope that sharing the contents will help those who are preparing for many coding tests 汨
