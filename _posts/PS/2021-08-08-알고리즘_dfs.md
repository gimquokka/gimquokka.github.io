BFS&DFS are probably one of the most frequent and important types of questions in various interviews and coding tests. I've also encountered this type every time through several coding tests so far. 

In this post, I would like to post about the DFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm. I try to make it as simple as possible with Python, so I hope it helps a lot of people!üôè

## DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithm

```python
def dfs(graph, v, visited):
    visited[v] = True

    for i in graph[v]:
        if not visited[v]:
            dfs(graph, i, visited)
```
