# Solution

There are three solution to solve this problem.

1. Use a non-personal Team provisioning profile

2. Run on the 13.3.1 version on simulator not a real device

3. Downgrade real iOS device‚Äôs version under 13.3.1

## 1. Use a non-personal Team provisioning profile

In my case, Solve the problem this way. ***when I changed provisioning profile in general tab personal to corporate\***. Problem was solved. this problem is just system error. So, we have to wait or fix React Native Library to compensate for error. Modify our RN code does not make chagne.

## 2. Run on the 13.3.1 version on simulator not a real device

It‚Äôs confirmed that react native app **a\*lready distributed from Apple App Store don‚Äôt make a crush\*** on real device iOS version 13.3.1**.** Therefore, if your purpose is to run RN project just for debugging app working, Test it on Simulator. Because Customer will not face such problems in real case.

## 3. Downgrade real iOS device‚Äôs version under 13.3.1

If you have to run RN project in real device, but you don‚Äôt have corporate provisioning profile. Downgrade you iPhone iOS version lower than 13.3.1.
